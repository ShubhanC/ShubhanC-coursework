    "**Personal Motivation:** We chose the Video Games Dataset, because we were passionate about video games, and we've been playing since childhood. Personally, Shubhan initially saw Super Mario 64 DS at the top of the dataset, which is a game that he played as kid with his brother. Rudrakshi has played racing video games with her brother during summers. Both of us have personal connection to video games, so we were very interested in analyzing this dataset.\n",

They could look at how their video games are produced, how they are marketed, and how they are handled in the economy. Other companies could then adopt some of the principles to drive competition."

    "**Collection:** The data was collected by Dr. Joe Cox, who extracted the data from VGChartz.com. They extrapolated samples from small retail stores in order to produce their sales. While they are no longer able to produce accurate estimates for video game sales, they were able to collect these samples until 2018, when the digital sale market made these estimates unrepresentative. However, since the data is from before 2018, we can assume that these estimates are accurate.\n",

Second, There are lots of binary (logical) variables, with the majority of columns being binary. Furthermore, there is no codebook, making it very unclear what some of the columns are, such as \"LifeCycle\" and \"LifeCycleSq\"."

    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we analyzed the relationship between video game publishing company and median video game sales. We took samples of 5 companies and compare their median sales for their video games. One sample was from the top 50% of publishing companies (based on median sales) and the other sample was from the bottom 50% of publishing companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our data cleaning, we found that \"Pokémon\" games had missing characters due to how the data wasn't encoded with utf-8 encoding. After replacing the unrendered character with the 'é' character, there we no other missing or strange values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we wanted to group the data by publishing company name. However, we found that many games had either multiple publishing companies or were geographically based (such as Nintendo of Europe vs Nintendo of America). For this reason, we made sure that we only considered the first company listed in the \"Publisher\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "After grouping by publisher, we split the data into the top 50% of publishing companies and bottom 50%. Then we made two bar graphs to compare the median sales within each sample. Then, we combined the samples and used a bar graph to compare all of the companies in each sample. Through this bar graph, we found very few publishing companies are able to sell a lot. This was shown by the extreme outlier of Nintendo, which had a median 0.86 million sales, while the next highest in the sample had around 0.4 (Touchstone). We also found that most of the smaller companies seem to be competitive with each other, but they were far from being able to compete with Nintendo.\n",

    "We faced a lot of limitations in our data. First of all, there was an overwhelming amount of binary variable types in the data, making it much harder for us to do quantitative analysis. Second, we realized that with the overwhelming amount of publishers (over 100, with most of them being small publishers), it made us realize that even if we played a lot of video games growing up, we still haven't scratched the surface of developers. The big companies control the market, so we only see their work.\n",

    "In the future, if we did work in the future, we could incorporate some of the binary variables that we mostly ignored in this project. We could also incorporate variables suh as the ratings, maximum players, and price."
