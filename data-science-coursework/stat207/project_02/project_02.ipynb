    "This dataset represents the sales of over 1000 video games released between 2004 and 2010. The data was collected by Dr. Joe Cox, who extracted the data from VGChartz.com. They extrapolated samples from small retail stores in order to estimate sales. However, this data also has a number of other variables for each video game, including logical variables, release year, and review score. In this report, we will focus on **one logical variable** and **one quantitative variable.** These variables are **Nintendo** (if a game was released by Nintendo) and **Review Score** (how much the player based like a game).\n",
    "\n",
    "This data represents a sample, as it is nearly impossible to find every single game that was released between 2004 and 2010. Furthermore, the sales and review score figures are largely estimates as finding the ground truth would require that every single person that bought the game was surveyed as a part of data collection (which is impossible).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we have **2 research questions:**\n",
    "1. What proportion of video games released from 2004 to 2010 were released by Nintendo? What is a range of reasonable values for this proportion among all video games?\n",
    "2. How many video games have a high review score (≥80)? What is a reasonable range of values for this number in the population?\n",
    "\n",
    "As students that have played video games throughout our lives, other individuals that are interested in or are studying video games are interested in different video game companies and how people like these games. Nintendo has been such a large presence in the video game community, especially for younger audiences, so seeing their influence on the video game market may be interesting. Furthermore, as individuals who generally like video games, we want to see if the general public also shares the same sentiments as us. In a broader sense, if other developers see how dominant/non-dominant Nintendo truly is, they could adjust their practices to match Nintendo and potentially create some good competition in the video game space."

    "In this project, we looked at video games dataset and trends using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. We estimated how many games Nintendo released between 2004 and 2010 and checked whether this number was different from what we expected (6 %). Our statistical z-test showed that there was no significant difference. This means that the proportion of Nintendo games in our sample matched what we assumed, which was 5.9 % compared to 6 %. We also analyzed review scores, specifically how many games had high scores (80 or above), and estimated a reasonable range for this number in the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so we used confidence intervals and used a threshold of 95 % confidence. Our findings suggest that Nintendo’s game releases during the 2004 - 2010 were in line with expectations, and there wasn’t strong statistical evidence to suggest otherwise. The confidence interval analysis gave us an idea of how many games received high review scores. These insights could be be useful to understand how the video game industry is affected by these statistics and how do these numbers effect the review scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there were some limitations, like the dataset might not include every game from 2004 to 2010, which could definitely affect results as it would suggest that the dataset wasn't complete. Review scores can also be subjective and matter exclusively to each person and the connection that they have to the game. It could also be influenced by things like platform exclusivity or game popularity. In the future, similar analysis if done over a longer time period or maybe done with a broader range of games, game companies or even including players of said games, can be done to get a more complete picture. Overall, this project showed how statistical measures can help us analyze video game trends and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.\n"
