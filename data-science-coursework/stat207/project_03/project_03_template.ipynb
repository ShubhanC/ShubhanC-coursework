    "This dataset represents the sales of over 1000 video games released between 2004 and 2010. The data was collected by Dr. Joe Cox, who extracted the data from VGChartz.com. They extrapolated samples from small retail stores in order to estimate sales. However, this data also has a number of other variables for each video game, including **logical**, **quantitative**, and **categorical** variables. In this report, we will use predictions on the **Sales** and **Sequel** variables, where a $1$ in **Sequel** represents a game that is a sequel in a franchise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data represents a sample, as it is nearly impossible to find every single game that was released between 2004 and 2010. Furthermore, the sales figures are largely estimates as finding the ground truth would require that every single person that bought the game was surveyed as a part of data collection (which is impossible).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we have **2 research questions**: <br>\n",
    "1. What is the relationship between the **maximum players** that can play a video game and the **total number of US sales** for a video game released between 2004 and 2010, assuming that we hold other variables (Company, Used Price, Rating, Year Released, and if a game is Handheld) constant. Is this consistent between sample data and the underlying population? Is this model generalizable to new data?<br>\n",
    "2. What is the relationship between the log-odds of a video game having a sequel and the **console** that a video game was released on, **the year that it was released**, the **review score** of a game, and if the game is in the **3rd person perspective** in our training data for video games released between 2004 and 2010? Is this model applicable to any new data that we may introduce? Then, can we use a classifier based off of this model to predict whether any given game?\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, our response variables are **US Sales (millions)** and **Sequel**. **US Sales (millions)** is a **quantitative** variable that is an estimate of the total number of sales in the United States, collected through subsampling as described earlier. The **Sequel** variable is a **logical** variable, where a $0$ means that the video game is not a sequel of an existing video game franchise, while a $1$ means that the video game is a sequel of an existing video game franchise. For example, Spider-Man 2 is a **sequel** of Spider-Man.\n",
    "\n",
    "As students that have played video games throughout our lives, the posed research questions will allow video game enthusiasts and companies alike to analyze the qualities and structures that define a \"successful\" video game. A game that has large amount of sales, for example, may have a few reasons for why that game became so popular, and companies can analyze those variables for future business/development decisions. Another indicator of success is if a game is a sequel. If a game has a sequel, then the franchise is so successful that there is demand for a similar game. Companies and game enthusiasts can analyze what factors may play into a game being successful or not."

Is this model applicable to any new data that we may introduce? Then, can we use a classifier based off of this model to predict whether any given game?"

    "Summary: In our linear regression model, we attempted to predict the number of US Sales, in millions, for a video game from the maximum players that can play that game, the console it was released on, the used price of the game, the year that it was released, the rating of the game, and if it is a handheld game. Then, we tried to use inference to determine whether there is a relationship between the maximum number of players and sales. In our regression model, we got an $R^2$ value of $0.265$ and an RMSE of $0.894$, which means that our regression model is weak. Furthermore, we were able to establish (through inference) that there is a relationship between maximum number of players and sales of a game, but we are unable to trust this conclusion due to the fact that our model failed to check the linearity, normality, and equal variance conditions.\n",
    " \n",
    "In our logistic regression model, we attempted to predict whether a game is a sequel in a franchise based on which console the game was released on, what year the game was released, the average review score of that game, and if that game has a third person perspective. Then, we built a classifier to predict whether a game is a sequel or not. For our logisitic regression model, we got a pseudo-$R^2$ of $0.0779$ and an AUC of $0.688$. Our pseudo-$R^2$ suggests that our logistic regression model is extremely weak and does fit well to the training data. Our AUC suggests that a classifier created based off of the logistic regression model would be moderately strong. After building the classifier, we wanted to reduce the false positive rate, but after selecting a probability threshold of $0.53$, we found that our accuracy rate was low at $0.17$ and our specificity was $0.54$, which means that our false positive rate was $0.46$, which is very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations: First, one of the predictors we wanted to use for our linear regression model was price of the game. However, the dataset contained no data about initial price of the game, and only the used price, so we had to use that instead. Most of the data was in binary variables, including Rating and Company, which were both chosen predictors for our project. Which there were only 3 values for ratings, there were over 20 values for companies. Copy and pasting each one would’ve been an extreme hassle, so we decided to concat them all into one categorical variable that statsmodels could analyze. Furthermore, many of the column names featured spaces or other characters that caused the regression algorithms to fail. So, we had to remove those characters that made the algorithms fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "When constructing the logistic regression model, we realized that the Sequel variable, which was our response variable, contained values of 2 in the dataset. In the codebook, there was no indication of these values existing, so this we didn’t notice this quirk until we constructed our model. These values corresponded to expansions of existing games, but since we needed binary variables for the logistic model, we decided to consider these expansions as sequels (value of 1). Finally, in our logistic regression classifier, we tried to prioritize both false positives and accuracy, but unfortunately we were completely unable to improve both the false positive rate and accuracy at the same time. We believe that the data is too varied to be explained by a linear/logistic regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Work: In the future, the dataset could be modified to concat the company, rating, and game attribute variables, as it would be a lot easier to perform analysis with these variables as categorical. Then, a variable with the original price of the game could be added. Then, using forward/backward selection (removing unnecessary and collinear predictors), new linear/logistic regression models could be created that would be stronger than what we have in this project. With these news columns, new research questions trying to predict the release price of the video game (which may be more helpful) can be constructed."
