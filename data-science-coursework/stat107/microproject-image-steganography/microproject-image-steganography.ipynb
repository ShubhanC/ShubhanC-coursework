    "- We never want to change the blue (`b`) value of any pixel by more than 1 (ex: if the original value `b` value is `153`, our final value should be `152`, `153`, or `154` -- at most only adding or subtracting one to `153`).  Larger changes than this would almost certainly be easily detectable.\n",

    "- To store information in this way, we will hide our message by checking if the `b` value is an **even number** or an **odd number**.  Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will consider **all columns** but **only the first 27 rows** of any image (`y=0` to `y=26`).\n",
    "2. **Exactly one** `b` value in the first 27 rows of each column will be an **even value**.   All other `b` values in the first 27 rows will be an odd value.\n",
    "3. The **row** (y-value) in which the even value was found will represent the letter in our secret, hidden message.\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in the first row of the image, `y=0`, represents an `A`,\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=1` represents a `B`,\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=2` represents a `C`,\n",
    "    - ...and so on, until...\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=25` represents a `Z`, and\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=26` represents a space (` `).\n",
